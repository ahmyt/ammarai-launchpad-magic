    lede: "Campaigns rarely fail because the idea was bad. They fail because the brief sat in a shared doc for a week while everyone waited on someone else to write the first draft. AmmarAI exists to close that gap.",
    summary: "Turn a single campaign brief into ads, emails, and landing pages without the usual back-and-forth.",
    intro: [
      "A marketing team's calendar is a stack of half-finished things: a product launch that needs three ad variants by Thursday, a newsletter that's technically due but nobody's started, a landing page rewrite that's been 'in progress' since last sprint. The bottleneck is almost never strategy. It's the slow, unglamorous work of producing the actual words and assets that strategy depends on.",
      "AmmarAI is built around that reality. Instead of treating content creation as one big task, it breaks campaigns into the pieces marketers actually produce — headlines, ad copy, email sequences, social captions, landing page sections — and lets a team generate, tweak, and approve each one quickly, in a shared workspace where nothing has to be re-explained from scratch to a freelancer or a new hire."

    faqs: [
      { q: "Is this only useful for email, or does it help with other writing tasks too?", a: "Email is a common use case, but summarizing documents, drafting notes, and cleaning up rough text into clear messages are equally common uses for busy professionals." },
      { q: "Can it summarize a document I paste in, or only generate new writing?", a: "Both — you can paste in existing content to summarize or analyze, and separately generate new drafts like emails and notes from a short prompt." },
      { q: "Will using AI for routine emails make my communication feel impersonal?", a: "Drafts reflect the specifics you provide, so adding real context about the recipient and situation keeps replies from feeling generic, the same as with any fast-written email." },
      { q: "How much time does this realistically save in a normal week?", a: "It varies by how much routine writing your role involves, but most people notice the biggest time savings on the smaller, repetitive tasks rather than on any single large project." }
