    intro: [
      "\"Using AI for content creation\" means something different depending on who you ask. For some people it's typing a prompt into a chatbot and publishing whatever comes out. For others it's a tightly controlled pipeline where AI drafts, a human edits, and nothing goes live without a second look. The difference between those two approaches shows up immediately in the quality of the output — and increasingly in whether readers and search engines trust the content at all.",
      "This guide walks through a realistic content creation workflow that uses AI at each stage — research, drafting, images, video, and repurposing — while being honest about where AI genuinely saves time and where it introduces new problems, like generic phrasing, factual drift, and a sameness that readers can spot from a mile away.",

A one-line prompt like \"write a blog post about email marketing\" produces generic filler because there's nothing distinctive for the model to work with. A brief that includes your audience, your actual point of view, a few facts or examples only you would know, and the structure you want gives the model something worth shaping.",

They're weakest at judgment calls: what to cut, what's actually true, and what will resonate with a specific reader. A workable pattern is to generate a draft, then edit it as if a junior writer had handed it to you — because functionally, that's what happened.",

What they don't remove is the need for a clear creative direction. Vague prompts produce generic, slightly-off visuals; specific prompts with reference details, composition notes, and iteration produce usable ones.",
          "For video specifically, expect to iterate. Scripts need trimming for pacing, AI voiceovers need a listen-through for odd emphasis, and generated visuals often need a second pass to fix small inconsistencies (hands, text, reflections).

Turning a long article into a LinkedIn post, a script outline, or an email requires understanding a piece well enough to compress it — a task AI handles well because the source material constrains it.",

None of these are exotic risks — they happen by default when AI output is published without a real editing pass.",
