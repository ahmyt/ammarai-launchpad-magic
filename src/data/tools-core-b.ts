    what: [
      "AI Rewriter starts from text that already exists. You paste it, say what should change, and get a version that keeps the meaning while altering tone, length, complexity or structure. Because the source carries the facts, rewriting is usually more reliable than generating from scratch: there is less room for the model to invent things.",
      "The library has several rewriting tools and they are genuinely different. AI Rewriter is the general-purpose one for any text and any goal. The AI Content Rewriter is aimed at marketing content and repurposing across channels. The SEO Content Rewriter is aimed at published pages where search intent and internal structure need to be preserved. Start here when the job is simply making a piece of writing better.",
      "One thing it will not do is launder someone else's work. Rewriting a competitor's article to avoid plagiarism detection is still copying the substance, and it produces a page with nothing of your own in it. Rewrite your own material, or material you have the right to use.",
