URL Analysis crawls a live page and reports its SEO score, title and meta description, load time and status code, the issues it found, and whether the technical basics — HTTPS, mobile rendering, sitemap, robots.txt — are in place. Text Analysis takes a draft instead of a URL and reports word count, reading time, readability, keyword density and specific edits. Keywords takes a term and reports monthly volume, difficulty, CPC and competition, with related terms worth targeting.",
