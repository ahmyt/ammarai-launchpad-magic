      "AI Writer is the general-purpose text workspace inside AmmarAI. You open a blank document or paste something you already have, describe what you need, and work with the model directly in the page. It isn't one-shot generation: you keep editing in place — highlight a weak paragraph and rewrite it, ask for a tighter version of a sentence, or push a section from three hundred words to five hundred without touching anything else.",
      "It differs from the more specific generators in the library. The AI Article Generator is built around a full blog structure with headings and search intent. The AI Rewriter is built for reworking text you already have. AI Writer sits underneath both: it is the open surface you use when the format is not fixed, when you are writing a proposal, a landing page, an internal brief, a script outline or a piece of documentation.",
      "The output is a starting draft with your judgement applied on top. AmmarAI does not know your customer's objections, your legal constraints or last quarter's messaging unless you tell it, so the workflow that produces good writing is always the same: give it real context, generate, then edit hard.",

It handles dictation, voice memos, recorded calls and uploaded audio, returning punctuated, paragraphed text rather than an unbroken stream of words. Accuracy holds up well on clear speech and degrades predictably with background noise, heavy crosstalk and poor microphones.",
      "People often conflate it with transcription, and the distinction is worth keeping. Speech to text is about getting words out of audio quickly and using them somewhere else, usually your own words. AI Transcription is the fuller workflow product: multiple speakers, timestamps, speaker labels, searchable transcripts and export formats for subtitles. If you are dictating a draft, this is the tool. If you are processing a recorded interview, use transcription.",
      "The most underrated use is drafting. Speaking a first draft is roughly three times faster than typing one, and the text that comes out tends to be more direct because you were talking to a person rather than performing on a page.",
